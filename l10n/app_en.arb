  "tips_nutrition_text": "A balanced diet is essential. It is important to reach your maintenance calories or with a little caloric surplus (100 - 200) is sufficient for muscle gains. (There are many websites to calculate your calorie needs). \n -Make sure you consume enough protein (1.8 grams of protein multiplied by your weight) for muscle repair. \n-Carbohydrates are also essential, pre-workout is crucial to optimize performance, especially in long duration or high intensity exercise. \n-Slow-absorbing carbohydrates, such as whole-grain bread or fruit, can help keep energy levels stable throughout your workout.",

I was looking for something that would allow me to customize my routines, track my progress in sets, reps and weights, and have an accessible history but I was always finding service applications or with a very excessive cost to simply store numerical data, unnecessary and/or complex functions. \n \n \n The main goal is to provide a clear user experience, focused on the essential functionality for tracking strength training, allowing the user to concentrate on what's important: their progress and consistency. \n \n \n I sincerely hope you find this app useful in reaching your fitness goals - any feedback or suggestions for improvement would be greatly appreciated!",
