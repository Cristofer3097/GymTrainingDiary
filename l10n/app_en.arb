  "tips_tec": "Technique > Weight",

  "tips_progression": "Progressive Growth",

  "tips_rest": "Rest",
  "tips_rest_text": "Rest is as important as exercise. Sleep well (7-9 hours) this allows your muscles to recover between sessions. I recommend a 48-72 hour rest between sessions for the same muscle group.",
  "tips_series": "Rest between series",
  "tips_series_text": "3 minutes between sets are ideal for workouts that seek to increase maximum strength and power. They allow for a more complete recovery of the neuromuscular and energy system, which facilitates greater intensity and volume in subsequent sets.",
  "tips_nutrition": "Nutrition",
  "tips_nutrition_text": "A balanced diet is essential. It is important to reach your maintenance calories or with a little caloric surplus (100 - 200) is sufficient for muscle gains. (There are many websites to calculate your calorie needs). \n -Make sure you consume enough protein (1.8 grams of protein multiplied by your weight) for muscle repair. \n-Carbohydrates are also essential, pre-workout is crucial to optimize performance, especially in long duration or high intensity exercise. \n-Slow-absorbing carbohydrates, such as whole-grain bread or fruit, can help keep energy levels stable throughout your workout.",

  "tips_project": "\uD83D\uDE80 Why the Project",
  "tips_project_text": "This application, 'Gym Diary', was born from my personal need for a simple, direct and effective tool to keep a detailed record of my workouts at the gym. I was looking for something that would allow me to customize my routines, track my progress in sets, reps and weights, and have an accessible history but I was always finding service applications or with a very excessive cost to simply store numerical data, unnecessary and/or complex functions. \n \n \n The main goal is to provide a clear user experience, focused on the essential functionality for tracking strength training, allowing the user to concentrate on what's important: their progress and consistency. \n \n \n I sincerely hope you find this app useful in reaching your fitness goals - any feedback or suggestions for improvement would be greatly appreciated!",
